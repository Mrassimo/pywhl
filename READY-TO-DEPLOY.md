## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Get the Code
```bash
# Option A: Clone
git clone -b lightweight https://github.com/Mrassimo/pywhl.git

# Option B: Download ZIP
https://github.com/Mrassimo/pywhl/archive/refs/heads/lightweight.zip
```

### 2. Copy to Work PC
Just copy the entire folder. No installation needed!

### 3. Start Using
```batch
# Windows Command Prompt
pywhl.bat numpy pandas

# Windows PowerShell  
.\pywhl.ps1 requests flask

# Any platform
node pywhl.js django
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Copy files to work PC
- [ ] Run `pywhl --help` to verify it works
- [ ] Try `pywhl requests` to generate download page
- [ ] Open HTML in browser and download a wheel
- [ ] Run `node process-downloads.js` to process
- [ ] Run generated `install-wheels.bat` to install

## 🎯 Success Metrics

✅ **Zero Dependencies** - No npm install required
✅ **Proxy Friendly** - Browser handles authentication
✅ **Simple Interface** - One command does it all
✅ **Clean Codebase** - Only essential files remain
✅ **Beautiful Docs** - Clear, helpful, and professional

## 🔮 Next Steps

1. **Test on work PC** to confirm proxy bypass works
2. **Share with colleagues** who face similar issues
3. **Consider making lightweight the main branch** (see docs/MERGE-STRATEGY.md)

## 💬 Final Thoughts

This tool was born from the frustration of corporate firewalls blocking pip. Now, if your browser can access PyPI, you can get Python packages!

**Remember:** If your browser can see it, pywhl can download it! 🌐✨
